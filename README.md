# Bare Metal Zig on STM32

This is about using [Zig](https://ziglang.org) alone to directly program boards based on STM32F103xx MCU, such as "Blue
Pill" clones of Maple Mini.

## Requirements

- A Blue Pill board or similar, see [here](https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill.html) for general and
  physical info.
  
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) to build our examples. (I used version 0.13.0 here.)

- [ST-Link Tools](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink) to flash them.

- [STM32F103x8 Datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f103c8.pdf) to know what exactly is available
  in our MCU as the above reference manual describes the whole family.

## Target

One of the cool things about Zig is that (thanks to LLVM) it can compile for many architectures out of the box and yet
manages to keep its MacOS package size under 50MB without any external dependencies!

Zig expects its `-target` command line switch to be a dash-separated triple identifying architecture, operating system
and ABI (application binary interface) of the target system. See the whole list by running:

    zig targets | less

Our architecture is ARM, we don't have any OS and we don't care about any particular ABI, so we are going to use
`arm-freestanding-none` as our `-target`.

Another command line switch, `-mcpu`, should be used to specify the processor to generate the code for. STM32F103xx is
based on Cortext-M3, so consulting the list of supported targets the most logical choice seemed to be `cortex_m3`. I am
getting build errors when using one however (something about an instruction in `IT` block), so I decided to step back
to `cortex_m23` that seems to be a subset of Cortext-M3 instruction-wise, missing exactly the `IT` instruction. (I
don't expect the compiler to use "TrustZone" security extensions. We could also use `cortex_m0` to be 100% sure it
won't generate something unsupported.)

Before we go to the remaining compiler settings let's type in some code first. Let's make the classic "Blink" example toggling the on-board LED (see `v0/main.zig`). It's not going to be nice, but we'll improve it later.

## Version 0

Looking at the Blue Pill Schematic we see that the LED is attached to PC13 of the MCU which can be controlled via port 13 of GPIO bank C. GPIO and the corresponding registers are described in Chapter 9 of the Reference Manual, while the base address of bank C, `0x4001_1000`, can be found in the STM32F103x8 Datasheet. 

Before we can use the GPIO bank C however we need to enable it via one of the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) registers (base `0x4002_1000`), see chapter 7.3. GPIO bank C is controlled by bit 4 of `RCC_APB2ENR`, offset `0x18`:

```zig
reg(0x4002_1000 + 0x18).* |= 1 << 4;
```

Where `reg()` is a simple wrapper that gets us a `volatile` pointer, which we need when working with memory mapped registers for Zig's optimizer to not try removing or reorder our reads/writes.

```zig
fn reg(comptime address: u32) *volatile u32 {
    return @ptrFromInt(address);
}
```

Before we can start toggling port 13 however we need to configure it as output via `GPIOx_CRH` register (offset `0x04`, see chapter 9.2.2). Each nibble in this register is responsible for configuration of ports 8-15:

```zig
reg(0x4001_1000 + 0x04).* |= 0b01_10 << (4 * (13 - 8)); // Relying on the reset value being 0b01_00.
```

We'll be using `GPIOx_BSRR` register (offset `0x10` from the base, see chapter 9.2.5) to control the output state of our port. Setting bits 0-15 here sets the output on ports 0-15 to 1, while setting bits 16-32 *resets* the output on the same ports. (This register is more convenient than more traditional `GPIOx_ODR`, because there is no need to read its current state to modify a single bit.)

```zig
const GPIOC_BSRR = reg(0x4001_1000 + 0x10);
while (true) {
    GPIOC_BSRR.* = 1 << (13 + 16);
    delay(50);
    GPIOC_BSRR.* = 1 << 13;
    delay(950);
}
```

To implement `delay()` we'll just do something in a long loop. (We'll return to better implementation in the next version of the example.)

```zig
fn delay_ticks(ticks: u32) void {
    var i = ticks;
    while (i > 0) {
        // Reading any location to prevent the loop from being optimized out.
        _ = reg(0x2000_0000).*;
        i -= 1;
    }
}
```

To calculate the number of ticks we need to iterate to get a millisecond delay we need to know that after reset our CPU runs approximately at 8MHz and that every iteration in the above loop takes 6 CPU cycles (more on this below):

```zig
fn delay(comptime ms: u32) void {
    delay_ticks(ms * 8_000 / 6);
}
```

## Linker Script

OK, now when we have a basic program (see `v0/main.zig`) we can try to compile it:

    zig build-exe -target arm-freestanding-none -mcpu cortex_m23 -O ReleaseSmall -femit-asm main.zig

The extra `-femit-asm` flag makes Zig produce assembly output which is handy when examining our code. For example, this is how we can calculate how many CPU clock cycles `delay_ticks()` spends per tick (comments added by me using info on [this page](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0337/e/Instruction-Timing/Processor-instruction-timings)):

```asm
main.delay_ticks:           ; r0 contains the number of ticks already.
    movs    r1, #1
    lsls    r1, r1, #29     ; (1 << 29) is this 0x20000000 address we are reading from below.
.LBB1_1:
    cbz r0, .LBB1_3         ; 1 cycle, branch not taken. (Jump out of the loop if tick counter in r0 is zero.)
    ldr r2, [r1]            ; 2 cycles. (Our fake read.)
    subs    r0, r0, #1      ; 1 cycle. (Decrement the tick counter in r0.)
    b   .LBB1_1             ; 2 cycles, branch is taken. (Repeat the loop.)
.LBB1_3:
    bx  lr                  ; Return from the function.
```

Speaking of assembly, we could also disassemble the output file directly with `objdump -d main`, but it might be harder to see what's going on, here is the same `delay_ticks()` function:

    20130: 2101             movs    r1, #1
    20132: 0749             lsls    r1, r1, #29
    20134: b110             cbz r0, 0x2013c <.text+0x50> @ imm = #4
    20136: 680a             ldr r2, [r1]
    20138: 1e40             subs    r0, r0, #1
    2013a: e7fb             b   0x20134 <.text+0x48>    @ imm = #-10
    2013c: 4770             bx  lr

Another thing that we can see with `objdump` is that our code starts at address `000200ec` which is quite wrong for our MCU where flash memory begins at `0x08000000`:

    main:   file format elf32-littlearm

    Disassembly of section .text:

    000200ec <.text>:
       200ec: 480c          ldr r0, [pc, #48]           @ 0x20120 <.text+0x34>
       200ee: 6801          ldr r1, [r0]
       200f0: 2210          movs    r2, #16
    ...

Well, this is logical because Zig does not really know much about our MCU. We need to help it by writing a "linker script". The official documentation on the topic mentioned above is easy to read and actual scripts are fairly self-explanatory.

The first thing we do in our script (`v0/bluepill.ld`) is describing relevant memory regions, which is quite simple in our case as we have 128K of flash memory starting at `0x08000000` and 20K of RAM starting at `0x20000000` (see chapter 4 in the Datasheet):

    MEMORY {
        flash (rx)  : o = 0x08000000, l = 128K
        sram (rw)   : o = 0x20000000, l = 20K
    }

(The names of the regions can be arbitrary here, the linker does not know what the "flash" is.)

The next part of the script tells what should be placed into the flash memory:

    SECTIONS {
        .text : {
            ...
        } >flash

We cannot tell it to begin filling with the code from the start as the first word has to be the value of the main stack pointer (MSP), as per chapter 2.1.2 of the Programming Manual:

> On reset, the processor loads the MSP with the value from address 0x00000000.

(The address is from the start of the flash, `0x08000000` in our case.)

Next go interrupt vectors (see table 63 in the Reference Manual) of which we are only interested in the first one, Reset, as we don't use interrupts just yet:

    .text : {
        /* The initial value of SP, past the end of RAM. */
        LONG(ORIGIN(sram) + LENGTH(sram))
        /* Reset vector. */
        LONG(_start)
        /* We should put a bunch of other vectors here, but since none are used yet we can use the space. */
        /* So now goes our code. */
        *(.text)
        /* Then read-only data. */
        *(.rodata.*) 
        *(.rodata) 
    } >flash

Next we tell that our writable data (static variables) is expected in RAM. We don't have such variables in our simple example yet, but that'll be handy later.

    .bss : { 
        *(.bss) 
    } >sram

And finally we exclude a few extra code segments that otherwise would increase the size of our binary:

    /DISCARD/ : { 
        /* I don't want to keep sections needed only when printing stack traces. */
        *(.ARM.*)
    }

Let's compile using our linker script now:

    zig build-exe -target arm-freestanding-none -mcpu cortex_m23 -femit-asm -O ReleaseSmall --script bluepill.ld main.zig

Disassembling with `objdump` shows that the addresses are correct now:

    main:   file format elf32-littlearm

    Disassembly of section .text:

    08000000 <.text>:
     8000000: 20005000      andhs   r5, r0, r0
     8000004: 08000009      stmdaeq r0, {r0, r3}
     8000008: 6801480c      stmdavs r1, {r2, r3, r11, lr}
    ...

The first word appears to be the desired stack pointer just beyond the RAM followed by the Reset vector pointing to the next word. The number is even to indicate Thumb mode. Let's add `--mcpu=cortex-m23` to force Thumb mode:

    08000000 <.text>:
     8000000: 5000          str r0, [r0, r0]
     8000002: 2000          movs    r0, #0
     8000004: 0009          movs    r1, r1
     8000006: 0800          lsrs    r0, r0, #32
     8000008: 480c          ldr r0, [pc, #48]           @ 0x800003c <.text+0x3c>
     800000a: 6801          ldr r1, [r0]
     800000c: 2210          movs    r2, #16
     ...
     
OK, now the part starting at `0x8000008` looks like the code in our `.s` file.

## Flashing

We'll be using `st-flash` utility which expects either a raw binary with the starting address passes separately or an Intel hex file that already contains addresses. Let's use the latter by converting our build to `.hex` with Zig:

    zig objcopy -O hex main main.hex

Flashing is then as simple as:

    st-flash --reset --format ihex write main.hex 

You'll see something like this and your LED will hopefully start blinking every second:

    st-flash 1.8.0
    2024-08-18T22:01:38 INFO common.c: STM32F1xx_MD: 20 KiB SRAM, 128 KiB flash in at least 1 KiB pages.
    2024-08-18T22:01:38 INFO common_flash.c: Attempting to write 90 (0x5a) bytes to stm32 address: 134217728 (0x8000000)

    2024-08-18T22:01:38 INFO common_flash.c: Flash written and verified! jolly good!

Also, as you can see our code is just 90 bytes, which is quite nice given all the required setup instructions.

## V1

Now let's improve the example showing some power of Zig:

```zig
export fn _start() noreturn {
    const bankC = GPIOBank(.C);
    bankC.init();

    const led = bankC.port(13);
    led.setOutput(.openDrain, .max2MHz);

    while (true) {
        led.reset();
        delay(50);
        led.set();
        delay(950);
    }
}
```

The `GPIOBank` is an abstraction that is more readable, more reusable (we can use all banks/ports) but does not add any overhead as all the selection of the bank and port happen at compile time. Our program is 94 bytes now, which is just 4 bytes larger only because we are not relying on the reset values when writing to `GPIOC_CRH` as we want to change pin configuration at runtime:

```zig
pub fn GPIOBank(comptime bank: GPIOBankIndex) type {
    return struct {
        /* ... */
        pub fn port(comptime pin: u4) type {
            return struct {
                fn reg(comptime offset: u32) *volatile u32 {
                    return @ptrFromInt(switch (bank) {
                        .A => 0x4001_0800,
                        .B => 0x4001_0C00,
                        .C => 0x4001_1000,
                        .D => 0x4001_1400,
                        .E => 0x4001_1800,
                    } + offset);
                }

                fn setModeBits(comptime bits: u32) void {
                    const CRx = reg(if (pin >= 8) 0x04 else 0x00);
                    const shift = 4 * @as(u8, if (pin >= 8) pin - 8 else pin);
                    CRx.* = CRx.* & ~(@as(u32, 0xF) << shift) | (bits << shift);
                }
                
                const BSRR = reg(0x10);

                pub fn set() void {
                    BSRR.* = 1 << pin;
                }
                /* ... */
            };
        }
    };
}
```

As you can see `reg()` depends on the bank, but since both `bank` and `pin` are `comptime`, thus both `GPIOx_CRx` (L or H) and `GPIOx_BSRR` are picked at compile time as well and we always get highly optimized code.

## V2

Here we are adding a `SysTick` timer for a better `delay()` along with `USART` to say the actual `Hello`. (I've moved all helpers into a module called `z41` here.)

Our binary is `792` bytes now, or `314` if we completely remove the line with `usart.writer.print`, and `432` if we keep it but don't output the number. In other words, the use of `std.fmt` adds overhead only when specifiers are actually used, something that would be hard to achieve with a `printf()`-style C/C++ function.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const z41 = @import("z41");

export fn _start() noreturn {
    const rcc = z41.RCC(.internalRC);
    rcc.init();

    const SysTick = z41.SysTick(rcc.SYSCLK, 50);
    SysTick.init();

    const led = z41.GPIO(rcc, .C).port(13);
    led.Bank.init();
    led.setOutput(.openDrain, .max2MHz);

    const usart = z41.USART(rcc, .usart1);
    usart.init(115200);

    usart.writeBytes("\nHello! It's V2\n\n");

    while (true) {
        led.reset();
        SysTick.delay(50);

        led.set();
        SysTick.delay(950);

        try usart.writer.print("\rUptime: {}s", .{SysTick.milliseconds() / 1000});
    }
}
```

### RegisterSet

I've added `RegisterSet` under the hood to help with definition of hardware registers. It's similar to this `reg()` helper from `v0`, but allows using structs as well. For example, this is how `STK_CTRL` is described in `SysTick` (you should appreciate Zig allowing anonymous enums like here in `CLKSOURCE`):

```zig
const STK_CTRL = regs.at(0, packed struct(u32) {
    /// Counter enable.
    ENABLE: bool,
    TICKINT: bool,
    CLKSOURCE: enum(u1) {
        /// AHB/8.
        AHB_8 = 0,
        /// Processor clock (AHB).
        AHB = 1,
    },
    _r1: u13 = 0,
    COUNTFLAG: bool = false,
    _r2: u15 = 0,
});
```

You can still use raw `u32` registers where needed:

```zig
const STK_LOAD = regs.at(4, u32);
```

The helper checks the type you pass to make sure it's `u32` or `u32`-backed `packed struct`:

```zig
pub fn at(comptime offset: u32, comptime reg_type: type) *volatile reg_type {
    const valid = switch (@typeInfo(reg_type)) {
        .Struct => |s| switch (s.layout) {
            .@"packed" => s.backing_integer == u32,
            else => false,
        },
        .Int => |i| i.bits == 32,
        else => false,
    };
    if (!valid) {
        @compileError("Expected `reg_type` to be u32 or a packed struct backed by u32");
    }
    return @ptrFromInt(base + offset);
}
```

### SysTick

A `SysTick` timer is described in the chapter 4.5 of the Programming Manual and is something common to all processors based on CortexÂ®-M3. It's a simple counter that is decremented on every (or every 8ths) CPU clock cycle and generates an interrupt when it reaches zero. It can be used to implement a notion of system time (e.g. milliseconds since system start) along with better delays, where we don't have to rely on how exactly our code is compiled.

We need to be able to handle interrupts for this helper and this is where our linker script needs to be changed. The handler itself is simple:

```zig
pub fn SysTick(comptime cpuFreq: u32, comptime msPerTick: u32) type {
    return struct {
        export fn SysTick_Vector() void {
            total_ms +%= msPerTick;
        }

        var total_ms: u32 = undefined;
        ...
```

It needs to be `export`ed for our linker script to place a pointer to it into an appropriate location. (Note that the export only happens when `SysTick` is used, something that would be hard to achieve in C/C++ without macros.) 

Other than `export` no other attributes are needed here thanks to the clever way interrupts ("exceptions") are handled (see chapter 2.3.7 in the Programming Manual):

- registers `r0`-`r3` are automatically pushed to the stack along with flags when an interrupt occurs, while remaining registers are already expected to be preserved by the compiler even in regular functions;

- unlike other architectures no special "return from interrupt" instruction is needed, because the return address in `LR` register is set to a special value that any return from function (`bx lr`) will be recognized as a return from an interrupt restoring `r0`-`r3`, etc.

So we need to add a pointer to our handler into the interrupt vector table at the start of our code (see table 63 in the Reference Manual again):

    .text : {
        ...
    	LONG(_start);
    
        /* We don't use any interrupt vectors before SysTick, so let's just fill.  */
        FILL(0); . = ADDR(.text) + 0x003C;
    
        LONG(DEFINED(SysTick_Vector) ? SysTick_Vector : 0xDEAD);
    
    	/* Other vectors follow, but since we are not using them we can just start our code earlier. */
        ...

Note the use of `DEFINED`: it allows correct linking even when the target program does not need the `SysTick` timer. (By the way, the use of `0xDEAD` for undefined handlers is temporary here, a central "panic" handler halting the MCU would be a better option eventually.)

### `build.zig`

I've been using a simple shell script to build and flash the first 2 examples:

```bash
#!/bin/sh -e
zig build-exe \
	-target arm-freestanding-none \
	-mcpu cortex_m23 \
	-femit-asm \
	-O ReleaseSmall \
	--script bluepill.ld \
	main.zig
zig objcopy -O hex main main.hex
rm main main.o
st-flash --reset --format ihex write main.hex 
```

However in this one we want to be able to pull our helpers from a "module" in `./lib`. This still could be described in a shell script of course, but I also was curious about Zig's build system, so I've added `build.zig`.

Now the example can be compiled with `zig build` or flashed with `zig build flash`.
